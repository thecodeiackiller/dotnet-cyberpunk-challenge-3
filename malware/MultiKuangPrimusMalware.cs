        TODO: Challenge3 - Tasks
            1. First we need to fix how the generics work with this class. This is a little similar to
            what you did in the `MultiKuangMalwareFamily` for challenge2.
            Notice that T and Z are already being passed to the base class. Where are they being passed *from*?
                - We need to put a T and Z in the `<>` for this class; it will be "passed" to the base class as well

            2. Like we did in challenge2 we need to set the `where` type constraints correctly. Remember 
            this should look like `where T : SomeClass`. The spacing format of the `where` statements on two lines
            is just for readability. You'll need to match the same `where` constraints that you used in the
            base class. FYI This is going to allow the code to infer how you're gonna use the types throughout
            this file.
                - Check what the `where` statements say in the base class. You'll use the same constraints

            3. Since this class was inspired by the Arasaka Kuang variant malware there are mentions of
            `ArasakaMessageRoot`. 
                - Please check for where you can replace `ArasakaMessageRoot` with `T`
                - Notice that there are conditional blocks that are checking "if T is MilitechMessageRoot"
                or "if T is ArasakaMessageRoot"; we DON'T want to change how those conditionals work so keep
                your eyes peeled!
                - There are some variables that are declared with type `ArasakaMessageRoot`. These are probably
                good to change to T.

            4. Go back to Handler.cs
