                OBJECTIVE: We've learned that Militech has just stolen a number of files from
                Arasaka and while that's great we also want our hands on those files. We can't
                break into Militech YET. 
                
                First we need you to adapt the Kuang malware we used on Arasaka to also be able
                to attack Militech without losing any capability to attack Arasaka either. The
                trick is to make the Kuang malware generic enough that can we spin up an attack
                process for both of them at a moment's notice.

                Couple concepts you'll need to remember from your recent adventures:
                - Async/await and how the `Task` datatype works
                - Generics
                - Abstraction (hiding all the super complicated stuff, like we're doing in the path
                 `lib/_lib/`)
                - Remember we're talking with an actual API and getting data back. Feel free to
                explore "under the hood" in the functions in _lib/

                Good luck!

                malware and the Initialization. Both of the variants have their own Server Connections. This
                needs to be genericized, meaning that we need to go create some generic code to handle this.
                Right now for this challenge we only care about genericizing the ServerConnection because
                we're gonna do more genericizing later.
                    1. Use `F12` on the arasakaIceBreaker's `Initialize()` method. Find more info there! 
                    2. Assuming you completed step 1, then use `F12` to go into 
                    militechIceBreaker's `Initialize()` method

            we're going to make a new base class to use instead. We're going to ABANDON using the `KuangMalwareFamily.cs`
                in favor of the MULTI Kaung Malware Family base class to make sure our changes are going to work.

            1. We need to swap the `ArasakaKuangPrimusMalware` and `MilitechKuangPrimusMalware` to use the base class
                `MultiKuangDaemonFamilyBase`. So `F12` into the `ArasakaKuangPrimusMalware` class and do the tasks
                listed as `TODO: challenge2`

                2. You'll notice that you're probably getting red squigglies on `GetArasakaProcessList` below. Change this
                to be the `GetProcessList()`.

                3. Repeat step 1 but do this for `MilitechKuangPrimusMalware`.

                4. You'll notice that you're probably getting red squigglies on `GetMilitechProcessList` below. Change this
                to be the `GetProcessList()`.
                
                5. Move on to the next challenge!

                Did you complete it? Yeah?
                Let's run it! Set a breakpoint somewhere and see if you can step through it and explore!
                Generics can be quite satisfying to implement but the mental toll of keeping track during implementation
                can be intense. Get prepared for the homework ;)
